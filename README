Dokkit TextMate Bundle
Copyright (C) 2008 toddb todd@8wireunlimited.com

To be used with dokkit - a ruby documentation generator. To install 'gem install dokkit' see http://dokkit.rubyforge.org

Main functions:
 * Rake integration for building
 * Preview in Browser
 * List of formats for chars and paragraphs
 * Document structure formats

Also see:
* tmbundles on github: http://github.com/kballard/textmate-bundles/tree
* rake installer for bundles: http://github.com/shanesveller/textmate-bundles-rake/tree

TODO
====

* Split the bundle between Dokkit and Deplate
* Create a New File Template (this didn't work as planned so I backed it)
* Fix image dragging command: Deplate/Dokkit is not working with an img - currently when dragging an image to the file it formats in markdown - this does not output correctly
* Merge this bundle into tmbundles on GitHub
